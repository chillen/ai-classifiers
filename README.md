# ai-classifiers
These are my classifiers for my AI class. First real project in python!

# Installing

Make sure to get the necessary dependencies! Must have installed [pip](https://chocolatey.org/packages/pip) 
which I believe comes with [python](https://chocolatey.org/packages/python). Linking for Windows users.

Then, in the root directory, use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` and all requirements should
magically appear. Fill the data folder with some csv's and you're good to go!
